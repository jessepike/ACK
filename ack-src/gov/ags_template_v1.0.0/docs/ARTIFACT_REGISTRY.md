## Purpose

Define the Artifact Registry as a **derived control-plane artifact** that indexes Tier 1–3 artifacts.

## Rule

- `artifacts/ARTIFACT_REGISTRY.json` is generated by `scripts/validate_ags.py`.
- Do not hand-edit the JSON registry.
- The authoritative metadata source is the YAML frontmatter in each artifact.

## Generation

Run:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_ags.py --write-registry
```
