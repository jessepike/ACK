# [Project Name] - Concept

## Purpose

<!-- This is a working document for concept iteration -->

This document captures the evolving concept for [Project Name]. It's meant to be iterated on until the concept is clear enough to synthesize into a brief.

**Status:** [Early exploration / Refining / Ready for brief]

---

## The Idea

### One-Liner

<!-- Explain the concept in a single sentence -->

[Project Name] is a [type of thing] that [what it does] for [who].

### Elevator Pitch

<!-- 30-second explanation -->

[2-3 sentences expanding on the one-liner. What is it? What problem does it solve? Why does it matter?]

---

## Problem Space

### The Problem

<!-- What pain point or need does this address? -->

[Describe the problem in plain language. Be specific about who has this problem and how it affects them.]

### Current Alternatives

<!-- How do people solve this problem today? -->

| Alternative | How It Works | Why It Falls Short |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| [Alternative 1] | [Description] | [Gap or limitation] |
| [Alternative 2] | [Description] | [Gap or limitation] |
| [Do nothing] | [What happens] | [Cost of inaction] |

### Why Now?

<!-- Why is this the right time for this solution? -->

- [Timing factor 1 - e.g., technology enabler]
- [Timing factor 2 - e.g., market shift]
- [Timing factor 3 - e.g., behavioral change]

---

## Target Users

### Primary User

**Who:** [Description of primary user]

**Their context:** [Where/when they encounter the problem]

**Their goal:** [What they're trying to achieve]

**Their pain:** [What frustrates them about current solutions]

### Secondary Users (if any)

**Who:** [Description]

**Relationship to primary:** [How they relate]

---

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept

<!-- What is the solution at a high level? -->

[Describe the solution approach in 2-3 paragraphs. Focus on what it does, not how it's built.]

### Key Capabilities

<!-- What can users do with this? -->

| Capability | Description | Value to User |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| [Capability 1] | [What it does] | [Why user cares] |
| [Capability 2] | [What it does] | [Why user cares] |
| [Capability 3] | [What it does] | [Why user cares] |

### User Experience Vision

<!-- What does using this feel like? -->

[Describe the ideal user experience. What's the "magic moment"? How does it make users feel?]

---

## Differentiation

### What Makes This Different

<!-- Why this approach vs. alternatives? -->

- [Differentiator 1]
- [Differentiator 2]
- [Differentiator 3]

### Unique Advantage

<!-- What can only YOU do? -->

[What's the unfair advantage, unique insight, or special capability that makes this viable?]

---

## Initial Scope Thinking

### Must Have (Core)

<!-- Essential for the concept to work -->

- [Core element 1]
- [Core element 2]
- [Core element 3]

### Nice to Have

<!-- Would enhance but not essential -->

- [Enhancement 1]
- [Enhancement 2]

### Explicitly Not

<!-- Things that might seem related but aren't part of this -->

- [Not this 1]
- [Not this 2]

---

## Success Vision

### What Success Looks Like

<!-- If this works, what's true? -->

- [Success indicator 1]
- [Success indicator 2]
- [Success indicator 3]

### How We'd Know It's Working

<!-- Early signals of success -->

- [Signal 1]
- [Signal 2]

---

## Open Questions

### Must Answer Before Brief

<!-- Critical questions that block moving forward -->

- [ ] [Question 1]
- [ ] [Question 2]
- [ ] [Question 3]

### Nice to Answer

<!-- Would be helpful but not blocking -->

- [ ] [Question 4]
- [ ] [Question 5]

---

## Assumptions

<!-- What are we assuming to be true? -->

| Assumption | Confidence | How to Validate |
|------------|------------|-----------------|
| [Assumption 1] | High / Medium / Low | [Validation approach] |
| [Assumption 2] | High / Medium / Low | [Validation approach] |

**Changes:**
- [What changed]
- [What changed]

**Why:**
- [Reason for change]

**Open items:**
- [What still needs work]

---

### [Date] - Initial Concept

**Starting point:**
- [Original idea]

**Key uncertainties:**

## Ready for Brief?

Before synthesizing into brief.md, confirm:

- [ ] Problem is clearly articulated
- [ ] Target user is defined
- [ ] Solution concept is clear
- [ ] Differentiation is identified
- [ ] Critical assumptions documented
- [ ] Major open questions answered
- [ ] Scope boundaries taking shape

If all checked, ready to create [brief.md](brief.md).
