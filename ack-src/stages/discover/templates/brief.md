# [Project Name] Brief

## Summary

<!-- One paragraph that answers: What is this and why does it matter? -->

[Project Name] is a [type of thing] that [what it does] for [who it serves]. It solves [core problem] by [key approach]. This matters because [why it's worth building].

---

## Problem

<!-- What problem are we solving? Be specific. -->

### Problem Statement

[Clear, concise description of the problem in 2-3 sentences]

### Who Has This Problem

| User Type | Pain Point | Current Workaround |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| [User 1] | [Their specific pain] | [What they do today] |
| [User 2] | [Their specific pain] | [What they do today] |

### Why Now

<!-- Why is this the right time to solve this? -->

[Market timing, technology enablers, or urgency factors]

---

## Solution

<!-- What are we building to solve this? -->

### Core Concept

[2-3 sentence description of the solution approach]

### Key Capabilities

| Capability | What It Does | Problem It Solves |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| [Capability 1] | [Description] | [Links to problem above] |
| [Capability 2] | [Description] | [Links to problem above] |
| [Capability 3] | [Description] | [Links to problem above] |

### Differentiation

<!-- Why this approach vs. alternatives? -->

**Compared to [Alternative 1]:** [How we're different/better]

**Compared to [Alternative 2]:** [How we're different/better]

**Our unique advantage:** [What only we can do]

---

## Scope

### In Scope (MVP)

<!-- What we WILL build in the first version -->

- [Feature/capability 1]
- [Feature/capability 2]
- [Feature/capability 3]
- [Feature/capability 4]

### Out of Scope (Deferred)

<!-- What we're explicitly NOT building yet -->

| Deferred Item | Reason | Revisit When |
|---------------|--------|--------------|
| [Item 1] | [Why deferred] | [Trigger for reconsidering] |
| [Item 2] | [Why deferred] | [Trigger for reconsidering] |
| [Item 3] | [Why deferred] | [Trigger for reconsidering] |

### Non-Goals

<!-- Things that might seem related but are NOT what we're doing -->

- **Not [thing 1]:** [Why this is explicitly not a goal]
- **Not [thing 2]:** [Why this is explicitly not a goal]

---

## Success Criteria

<!-- How will we know this worked? -->

### Must Have (MVP Success)

- [ ] [Measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 3]

### Should Have (Strong Success)

- [ ] [Measurable outcome 4]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 5]

### Aspirational

- [ ] [Stretch goal 1]
- [ ] [Stretch goal 2]

---

## Constraints

<!-- What limits our solution space? -->

| Constraint Type | Constraint | Impact on Solution |
|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| Technical | [e.g., Must work offline] | [How this shapes design] |
| Resource | [e.g., Solo developer] | [How this shapes scope] |
| Timeline | [e.g., Need MVP in 4 weeks] | [How this shapes priorities] |
| Budget | [e.g., $0 infrastructure cost] | [How this shapes stack] |

---

## Risks

<!-- What could go wrong? -->

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [How to reduce/handle] |
| [Risk 2] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [How to reduce/handle] |
| [Risk 3] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [How to reduce/handle] |

---

## Validation

<!-- Evidence that this is worth building -->

### Problem Validation

<!-- How do we know the problem is real? -->

- [Evidence 1: e.g., user interviews, data, personal experience]
- [Evidence 2]

### Solution Validation

<!-- How do we know this solution will work? -->

- [Evidence 1: e.g., prototype feedback, similar products, technical feasibility]
- [Evidence 2]

### Assumptions

<!-- Key assumptions we're making -->

| Assumption | How to Validate | Status |
|------------|-----------------|--------|
| [Assumption 1] | [Validation approach] | Validated / Unvalidated |
| [Assumption 2] | [Validation approach] | Validated / Unvalidated |
