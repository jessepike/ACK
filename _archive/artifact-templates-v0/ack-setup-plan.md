## Dependencies Graph

```
[Visual representation of phase/feature dependencies]

Phase 1
  └── Phase 2
        ├── Phase 3a
        └── Phase 3b
              └── Phase 4

Or use a table:

| Feature | Depends On |
|---------|------------|
| [Feature A] | - |
| [Feature B] | Feature A |
| [Feature C] | Feature A |
| [Feature D] | Feature B, C |
```

## Human Checkpoints

Points where human review/approval is required before continuing:

| Checkpoint | After Phase | Review Focus | Reviewer |
|------------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| CP1 | 1 | [Foundation architecture] | [Role] |
| CP2 | 2 | [Core feature completeness] | [Role] |
| CP3 | 3 | [Integration quality] | [Role] |
| CP4 | 4 | [Launch readiness] | [Role] |

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Strategy] |
| [Risk 2] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Strategy] |

### Scope Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| [Scope creep] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Strict scope boundary] |
| [Underestimation] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Buffer time] |

---

## Out of Scope (Reminder)

From `discovery/scope`:
- [Out of scope item 1]
- [Out of scope item 2]
- [Out of scope item 3]

**Important:** These items are explicitly NOT part of this implementation plan.

---

## Success Criteria

### MVP Complete When:
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] [Criterion 3]

### Launch Ready When:
- [ ] All MVP criteria met
- [ ] [Additional launch criterion 1]
- [ ] [Additional launch criterion 2]
