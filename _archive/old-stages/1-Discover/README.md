# Stage 1: Discovery

## Intent

Validate and flesh out a concept enough to produce a Project Brief.

## Process

1. Start with raw concept/idea
2. Flesh out iteratively with planning agent
3. External validation loop (review with other agents)
4. Iterate based on feedback (3-5 cycles typical)
5. Synthesize into Project Brief

## Inputs

- Raw concept or idea
- Research materials (optional)

## Outputs

| Artifact | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Project Brief** | Deliverable | Validated concept → input to Design stage |
| Research docs | Supporting | Reference material, archived |
| Review feedback | Supporting | External agent feedback, archived |

## Exit Criteria

- Human judgment: concept is "good enough"
- External validation completed
- Project Brief synthesized

## Artifacts in This Directory

Place discovery artifacts here as they're created:
- `concept.md` - Working concept document
- `research/` - Research materials
- `reviews/` - External review feedback
