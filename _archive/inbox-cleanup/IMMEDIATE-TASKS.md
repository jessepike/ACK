- [ ] Core Features (your turn)
- [ ] Value Proposition
- [ ] Success Looks Like
- [ ] Non-Goals

**Daily goal:** 2-3 sections per day

### Day 3-4: Complete research.md
- [ ] Market Landscape - What category is IPE in?
- [ ] Competitive Analysis - Research Cursor, Cline, others
- [ ] Differentiation - What makes IPE unique?

**Key task:** Build the competitive comparison table with real data  
**End state:** You understand the competitive landscape clearly

---

### Day 5: Complete validation.md
- [ ] User Interviews - Talk to 3-5 developers
- [ ] Problem Validation - Do they have these pains?

**Key task:** Have actual conversations, even if informal  
**End state:** Validated (or invalidated) your assumptions

---

### Day 6-7: Complete scope.md

- [ ] Success Criteria - How do you measure success?

**Key task:** Be ruthless about what's NOT in v1.0  
**End state:** Clear MVP scope for Week 2 implementation

---

### Day 1-7: Capture Template Patterns (Ongoing)
- [ ] Create `template-notes.md` file
- [ ] Track which section structures work
- [ ] Note where you wanted agent help
- [ ] Document content length patterns

**Examples to track:**
- "This section works best as 2-3 paragraphs"
- "Agent could help with: competitive research"
- "Tables work better than prose for comparisons"

**End state:** Template patterns documented for future artifacts

---

## 🚀 END OF WEEK CHECKPOINT

### Review & Finalize
- [ ] All 4 Discovery artifacts complete
- [ ] Template patterns documented
- [ ] Agent wishlist compiled
- [ ] Files ready to use as Week 2 test data

### Share & Validate
- [ ] Show concept.md to 2-3 developer friends
- [ ] Get feedback: "Would you use this?"
- [ ] Incorporate feedback into scope.md

### Prepare for Week 2
- [ ] Review `ipe-schema-migration.sql`
- [ ] Review UI mockup one more time
- [ ] Read `bootstrap-guide.md` Week 2 section
- [ ] Set up Supabase account (if not already)

## 💡 MAINTAINING MOMENTUM

### Daily Habit
**Write for 1-2 hours every day**
- Morning: Best for creative writing (concept, validation)
- Afternoon: Good for research (competitive analysis)
- Evening: Review/edit what you wrote

### When You Get Stuck
**Don't stop - pivot:**
- Stuck on section → Skip to next section
- Stuck on artifact → Switch to different artifact
- Stuck on content → Write placeholder bullets, move on
- Stuck completely → Take 15 min break, come back

### Quick Wins
**Build momentum with small victories:**
- ✅ Finish one section → Celebrate
- ✅ Complete one artifact → Share with friend
- ✅ Get validation feedback → Update docs
- ✅ Finish Week 1 → Reward yourself

---

## 🔥 PRIORITY ORDER

**If time is limited, focus on:**

1. **concept.md** (CRITICAL)
   - Defines everything else
   - 80% of value
   - Needed for validation conversations

2. **scope.md** (HIGH)
   - Defines what you're building
   - Prevents Week 2 scope creep
   - Needed for timeline planning

3. **research.md** (MEDIUM)
   - Validates market opportunity
   - Informs differentiation
   - Can be refined iteratively

4. **validation.md** (MEDIUM)
   - Proves people want this
   - Identifies missing features
   - Can continue during Week 2

**Minimum viable Week 1:** concept.md + scope.md finalized

---

## 📞 WHEN TO START NEXT SESSION

**Good stopping points to hand off:**

### After Today
- "I've edited the concept.md drafts and written Core Features. Can you review?"
- "I finished concept.md sections 1-3, stuck on Value Proposition"

### After 2-3 Days
- "concept.md is done, starting research.md. Need help with competitive analysis"
- "Halfway through research, want to validate differentiation claims"

### After Week 1
- "All 4 Discovery artifacts complete! Ready to review and start Week 2?"
- "Week 1 done but template patterns unclear, need help extracting"

**Best practice:** Work in 2-3 day chunks, then review with agent before continuing

---
