# Starting Your Next IPE Session
## Quick Guide for Resuming Work

---

## 🎯 PASTE THIS TO START NEXT SESSION

```
I'm working on IPE (Integrated Planning Environment) - an AI-augmented 
planning tool for developers. Previous session completed UI/UX design, 
database schema, and created Discovery artifact templates.

Current status: Week 1 - Manually filling out Discovery artifacts
(concept.md, research.md, validation.md, scope.md) to validate workflow
before implementation.

Progress on artifacts:
- concept.md: [status]
- research.md: [status]
- validation.md: [status]
- scope.md: [status]

What I need help with: [specific question/section]

Context files in this project:
- PROJECT-HANDOFF.md (full context)
- IMMEDIATE-TASKS.md (current task list)
- All schema/design files in /mnt/user-data/outputs/
```

## 🔄 TYPICAL SESSION FLOWS

### Session Type 1: Content Review
**When:** You've written sections, need feedback

**Start with:**
> "I've completed [X sections] of concept.md. Can you review for clarity 
> and accuracy? Here's what I wrote: [paste content]"

**Agent will:**
- Review content
- Suggest improvements
- Point out gaps or unclear parts
- Help refine language

---

### Session Type 2: Writing Help
**When:** You're stuck on a section

**Start with:**
> "I'm stuck on the [section name] section of [artifact]. The section 
> should cover [X, Y, Z] but I'm not sure how to structure it. Can you 
> help draft or outline?"

**Agent will:**
- Provide draft or outline
- Ask clarifying questions
- Suggest structure options

---

### Session Type 3: Research Assistance
**When:** You need help gathering competitive info

**Start with:**
> "Working on research.md competitive analysis. Can you help me research 
> [Cursor/Cline/other tool] and summarize their key features, pricing, 
> and approach?"

**Agent will:**
- Research tools
- Summarize findings
- Build comparison tables
- Identify differentiation opportunities

---

### Session Type 4: Template Extraction
**When:** You've finished an artifact, need to capture patterns

**Start with:**
> "I just finished concept.md. Can you help me extract the template 
> patterns - which sections worked, what length/format, where I wanted 
> agent help?"

**Agent will:**
- Analyze completed artifact
- Extract template structure
- Document patterns
- Identify agent opportunities

---

### Session Type 5: Week Transition
**When:** Moving from Week 1 → Week 2

**Start with:**
> "Week 1 Discovery artifacts are complete. Ready to start Week 2 
> implementation. Can you help me set up the Next.js project and deploy 
> the Supabase schema?"

**Agent will:**
- Guide Next.js setup
- Walk through Supabase deployment
- Help structure project
- Set up initial components

---

## 💡 TIPS FOR EFFECTIVE SESSIONS

### Be Specific
**Good:** "Can you review my 'Core Features' section for clarity?"
**Bad:** "Is this good?"

### Show Your Work
**Good:** "Here's my draft: [paste content]. I'm unsure about..."
**Bad:** "Can you write this for me?"

### Ask for Options
**Good:** "Should this be prose or bullets? Show me both?"
**Bad:** "Which is better?" (without showing options)

### State Your Stage
**Good:** "I'm in Week 1, Day 3 - working on research.md"
**Bad:** No context about where you are

---

## 🚫 AVOID SESSION DRIFT

### Stay Focused
- **Each session = One clear goal**
- Finish one artifact before switching
- Don't jump between weeks randomly

### Prevent Scope Creep
- Week 1 = Writing only (no coding)
- Week 2 = Building only (no redesigning)
- Save "wouldn't it be cool if..." for later

### Know When to Stop
- Good stopping point: Artifact section complete
- Bad stopping point: Mid-thought, mid-section
- Always end with clear "next step"

## 📊 SESSION PROGRESS TRACKING

### After Each Session, Update:

**Progress checklist:**
```markdown
## Week 1 Progress (Update after each session)

### concept.md
- [x] What Is It? ← Completed Session 1
- [x] Problem Being Solved ← Completed Session 1
- [ ] Core Features ← Next session
- [ ] Value Proposition
- [ ] Success Looks Like
- [ ] Non-Goals

### research.md
- [ ] Market Landscape
- [ ] Competitive Analysis
- [ ] Differentiation
- [ ] Market Opportunity

### validation.md
- [ ] User Interviews
- [ ] Problem Validation
- [ ] Solution Fit

### scope.md
- [ ] MVP Definition
- [ ] In Scope
- [ ] Out of Scope
- [ ] Success Criteria
```

## ⚡ MOMENTUM KILLERS TO AVOID

### 1. Perfectionism
**Problem:** Endlessly editing the same section  
**Solution:** "Good enough, move on" - refine later

### 2. Analysis Paralysis
**Problem:** Researching competitors for 8 hours  
**Solution:** Set timer (2 hours max), then write

### 3. Scope Expansion
**Problem:** "We should also build X, Y, Z..."  
**Solution:** Add to "Future Ideas" section, not MVP

### 4. Tool Obsession
**Problem:** Spending days setting up perfect workflow  
**Solution:** Plain markdown files are fine for Week 1

### 5. Isolation
**Problem:** Writing in vacuum, no feedback  
**Solution:** Share drafts with friends, get reactions

---

## ✅ SESSION SUCCESS CHECKLIST

**After each session, verify:**

- [ ] Made concrete progress (section/artifact complete)
- [ ] Captured learnings (template patterns, agent needs)
- [ ] Know exactly what's next (no ambiguity)
- [ ] Files saved and accessible
- [ ] Ready to resume tomorrow

**If any ✗ above → Session wasn't productive**

---

## 🎯 WEEKLY RHYTHM

### Monday
- Start new artifact
- Fresh energy for creative writing

### Tuesday-Wednesday  
- Push through middle sections
- Research/analysis work

### Thursday-Friday
- Finish artifact
- Review/edit/refine

### Weekend (Optional)
- Share with friends for feedback
- Plan next week

---

## 🔥 MAINTAIN MOMENTUM

### Daily
- [ ] Write for 1-2 hours
- [ ] Track one template pattern
- [ ] Note one agent opportunity

### Weekly
- [ ] Complete 1-2 artifacts
- [ ] Share with someone
- [ ] Review progress vs. plan

### When Stuck
1. Skip section → Move to next
2. Switch artifacts → Fresh context
3. Take break → Come back later
4. Ask agent → Get unstuck
