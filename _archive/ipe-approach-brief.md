Approach Brief
Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
Goal: Nail down Intent + three cross-cutting systems to "good enough."
Deliverables:

Intent document (done above) → anchor into every stage
- how do we load this into project memory?

AGS finalized → frontmatter schema, validation scripts working, CLI wired

Memory Tier-1 complete → content taxonomy decided, CLAUDE.md templates per stage, rules structure defined
- memory is done when we have tier 1 defined, artifacts listed, created, and directory structure in place. readme for directory and current state...this is what memory is, what's in place for MVP, and what's on backlog.
- what's left to do for memory 

Registry organized → global/domain/project hierarchy clear, frontmatter retrofitted, domain packages complete
- same as memory, is it clearly defined, what are the pieces, what are we considering scope for MVP, what is still pending?

Done when: You can point at a project and say "this follows the system" with AGS validating, Memory persisting, Registry providing primitives.

Phase 2: Stage Scaffolding
Goal: Define each of the 5 stages to MVP completeness.
Per-stage checklist:

Stage purpose (one sentence outcome)
Required deliverables (first-class artifacts)
Supporting documents (templates, process guides)
Validation criteria (what "done" means)
MVP scope (essential vs. nice-to-have)

Sequence: Discovery → Design → Environment → Workflow → Implementation
Done when: You have a complete inventory of what each stage produces and what it needs to start.

Phase 3: Integration & Validation
Goal: Wire stages together, test end-to-end flow.
Tasks:

Define stage transition gates
Build handoff mechanisms (how outputs become next stage's inputs)
Create validation scripts for stage completion
Document workflow orchestration

Done when: You can walk a new project through Discovery → Implementation following the system.

Phase 4: Backfill & Deploy
Goal: Apply to in-flight projects, refine based on real use.
Tasks:

Select 1-2 in-flight projects
Retrofit into IPE workflow (backfill artifacts where possible)
Start new projects using full workflow
Capture gaps, iterate on templates

Done when: 3-4 projects actively using IPE, patterns validated, rough edges smoothed.

Immediate Next Actions

Save Intent artifact to project (anchor point established)
Complete AGS: Fix CLI wiring, finalize frontmatter, validate it works
Complete Memory Tier-1: Decide taxonomy, build CLAUDE.md templates
Complete Registry: Apply frontmatter, organize global/domain/project
Stage Inventory: List all artifacts per stage, classify deliverable/support/validation

Stop adding until foundation complete. No new systems, no new concepts. Finish what's started.
