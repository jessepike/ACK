### Detailed Inventory of Tips from Boris Cherny's Claude Code Workflow Thread

Boris Cherny (@bcherny), the creator of Claude Code at Anthropic, shared a 13-part thread detailing his personal setup and best practices for using Claude Code (a terminal-based AI coding assistant). The thread emphasizes a "vanilla" approach with minimal customization, parallel workflows, team collaboration, and verification loops. Below is a comprehensive, numbered inventory of all the specific tips he provided:

1. **Run multiple Claude sessions in parallel**  
   Run 5 Claude CLI sessions simultaneously in numbered iTerm tabs (1-5). Configure macOS system notifications in iTerm 2 to alert when a session needs input, allowing seamless multitasking without constant monitoring.

2. **Combine terminal, web, and mobile sessions**  
   Run 5-10 additional Claude sessions in parallel on claude.ai/code in the browser. Hand off local terminal sessions to the web using backgrounding (`&`), manually start web sessions, or use --teleport to move sessions between terminal and web. Also start sessions from the Claude iOS app (e.g., in the morning) and check in later.

3. **Prefer the strongest model for coding tasks**  
   Use Opus 4.5 with "thinking" enabled for all tasks. Despite being larger and slower than Sonnet, it requires less steering, excels at tool use, and ends up being faster overall.

4. **Maintain a shared, version-controlled documentation file**  
   The team shares a single `INSTRUCTIONS.md` (or similar docs) for the Claude Code repo, checked into git. Everyone contributes multiple times a week. Add guidance whenever Claude makes a mistake to prevent recurrence. Different teams maintain their own docs.

5. **Integrate Claude into code reviews**  
   During PR reviews, tag @.claude on coworkers' pull requests to suggest additions to the shared docs. Use the Claude Code GitHub action for this process (inspired by "Compounding Engineering").

6. **Leverage Plan mode for better execution**  
   Start most sessions in Plan mode (shift+tab twice). Iterate on the plan until satisfied, then switch to auto-accept edits mode—Claude can often implement it in one shot. Emphasizes that a strong plan is crucial for success.

7. **Create reusable slash commands for repetitive workflows**  
   Define slash commands in `.claude/commands/` (checked into git) for frequent "inner loop" tasks. Examples include a `/commit-push-pr` command that uses inline bash to pre-compute git status and other info, reducing back-and-forth and enabling Claude to use the workflow itself.

8. **Use subagents for common post-processing tasks**  
   Employ subagents (e.g., `code-simplifier` to clean up code after main work, `verify-app` for end-to-end testing of Claude Code) to automate recurring workflows across most PRs.

9. **Apply post-tool-use hooks for formatting**  
   Use a PostToolUse hook to automatically format Claude's generated code, catching the "last 10%" of formatting issues to prevent CI failures.

10. **Manage permissions proactively**  
    Avoid `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Instead, use `/permissions` to pre-allow safe, common bash commands. Store these in `.claude/settings.json` (shared with the team) to minimize permission prompts.

11. **Enable Claude to use external tools autonomously**  
    Configure tools like Slack (via MCP server for searching/posting), BigQuery (via bq CLI for analytics), and Sentry (for error logs). Share configurations (e.g., `.mcp.json`) team-wide so Claude handles these tasks independently.

12. **Handle long-running tasks with verification and minimal interruptions**  
    For extended tasks:  
    - Prompt Claude to self-verify with a background agent.  
    - Use an agent Stop hook for more reliable verification.  
    - Employ the "ralph-wiggum" plugin.  
    In sandboxes, use `--permission-mode=dontAsk` or `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to prevent blocking on prompts.

13. **Prioritize verification feedback loops (most important tip)**  
    Always give Claude a way to verify its own work—this can 2-3x the quality. Examples: Run bash commands, test suites, or UI testing via the Claude Chrome extension (which opens a browser, tests changes on claude.ai/code, and iterates). Invest in domain-specific, rock-solid verification methods.

These tips focus on efficiency through parallelism, automation of repetitive tasks, team knowledge compounding, and robust self-verification. Cherny notes there's no single "correct" way to use Claude Code and encourages customization.
